# Contributing to Python Package Repository
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make with the PO for the project or with the
[guardians](#project-guardians) of this repository before making a change.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Python Package Repository
project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and
feel free to propose changes to this document submitting a patch.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[ADP Code of Conduct](https://gerrit.ericsson.se/plugins/gitiles/adp-fw/adp-fw-templates/+/master/inner-source-templates/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Project Guardians
The guardians are the maintainer of this project. They are responsible to
moderate the [discussion forum](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3affba290d2dd2460582800f6e82aa68c7%40thread.tacv2/Python%2520Package%2520Repository?groupId=e5efb26a-ffdd-4815-a293-cc8c6c3627a3&tenantId=92e84ceb-fbfd-47ab-be52-080c6b87953f), guide the contributors and review the

## Development Environment prerequisites
The development framework for Python Package Repository is based on [bob](https://gerrit.ericsson.se/plugins/gitiles/adp-cicd/bob/). To be
able to run bob, the following tools need to exist on the host:
- python3
- bash
- docker
Bob expects you to have a valid docker login towards your docker registry on the
host, currently it can't handle automatic login by itself. If you are using
armdocker, then you can login with the following command:
```text
docker login armdocker.rnd.ericsson.se
```

## How can I use this repository?
This repository contains the source code ofPython Package Repository service including
functional and test code, documentation and configuration files for manual and
automatic build and verification.

If you want to fix a bug or just want to experiment with adding a feature,
you'll want to try the service in your environment using a local copy of the
project's source.

You can start cloning the GIT repository to get your local copy:
```text
git clone ssh://<userid>@gerrit.ericsson.se:29418/MXE/mlops-3pps/pypiserver-build
```
Once you have your local copy, you shall navigate to the root directory and
update the submodules needed to build the project:
```text
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
You can now build the service with the following command, from the root
directory:
```text
./bob/bob build image package
```
You can verify your build running the tests located in the folder `test`
using the following command:
```text
./bob/bob test
```
If you are satisfied with your change and want to submit for review,
create a new git commit and then push it with the following:
```text
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master
```
**Note:** Please follow the
[guidelines for contributors](#submitting-contributions)
before you push your change for review.
