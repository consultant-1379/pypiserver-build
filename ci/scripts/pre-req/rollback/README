Create directories with version numbers. 
Each version directory should have the below three files

Each folder can contain three files:

- pre
        Any bob rule that needs to be executed before delta commands. This is because, in the delta, we cannot have a bob rule added, as delta file itself will run from a bob rule. So, calling a bob rule from a bob rule is not supported.

- delta
        This file contains the commands that needs to be executed for that specific upgrade path. This will be initiated via a bob rule from mlops-builder codebase

- post
        Any bob rule that needs to be executed after commands in delta file. This is because, in the delta, we cannot have a bob rule added, as delta file itself will run from a bob rule. So, calling a bob rule from a bob rule is not supported. 

When snowball upgrade is done the folders between the upgrade from and to versions will be executed sequentially.
